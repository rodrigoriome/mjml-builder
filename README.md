# MJML Builder

#### Development

After installing dependencies, add your source files to the `src` folder. 

MJML files inside `src / templates` will be output as HTML in the` dist` folder. So it can be 
statically served to be viewed in your favorite browser.

A cool folder to have is `src/partials` where you store your reusable files, since they're not 
outputed to HTML.

After this initial setup, you can run `npm run dev` and your default browser should pop up, where
you can visualize your beaultiful email templates. ~~_As if emails could be beaultiful in any way..._~~

Happy development!
